					<p>I've always been a storyteller. When I was little, my cousin and I dreamt up a place called "Coo-Coo Town", where a planet of hotdogs and a planet of hamburgers were at war, where there were hotels run by robots, and all of our favorite characters lived in the same neighborhood. We built our universe out of scraps of construction paper, crayon doodles, and dreams.

					<br>As I got older, I started writing. I learned story structure, grammar, the hero's journey, and started assembling my own little narratives. I learned there was a way to imagine a universe and bring it to life with nothing but a computer and time. My stories started in glittery notebooks, and then were stored on a bright purple flash-drive, then finally moved to a set of color-coded folders in my Google Drive. 

					<br>My freshman year of high school, I signed up for an Intro to Computer Science class on a whim. I was out of my depth, and a little terrified, but I stuck with it. 

					<br>That class revolutionized my idea of what storytelling is. Suddenly my stories were not simply alive, they were working, solving problems and affecting change in the real world. Developers use data structures, design patterns, and algorithms to build their worlds.

					<br>I am passionate about using my skills to solve problems and create new things. I'm excited to continue learning and telling my stories.</p>
